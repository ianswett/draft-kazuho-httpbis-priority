--- abstract

This document describes a scheme for prioritizing the HTTP responses. The
prioritization scheme expresses absolute values for each HTTP response, rather
than the relative precedence between a group of HTTP responses.

This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial
priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
frames for reprioritizing the responses. These share a common format structure
that is designed to provide future extensibility.

# Introduction

It is common for an HTTP ({{!RFC7230}}) resource representation to have
relationships to one or more other resources.  Clients will often discover these
relationships while processing a retrieved representation, leading to further
retrieval requests.  Meanwhile, the nature of the relationship determines
whether the client is blocked from continuing to process locally available
resources.  For example, visual rendering of an HTML document could be blocked
by the retrieval of a CSS file that the document refers to.  In contrast, inline
images do not block rendering and get drawn progressively as the chunks of the
images arrive.

To provide meaningful representation of a document at the earliest moment, it is
important for an HTTP server to prioritize the HTTP responses, or the chunks of
those HTTP responses, that it sends.

HTTP/2 ({{?RFC7540}}) provides such a prioritization scheme. A client sends a
series of PRIORITY frames to communicate to the server a “priority tree”; this
represents the client's preferred ordering and weighted distribution of the
bandwidth among the HTTP responses.  However, the design has shortcomings:

* Its complexity has led to varying levels of support by HTTP/2 clients and
  servers.
* It is hard to coordinate with server-driven prioritization.  For example, a
  server, with knowledge of the document structure, might want to prioritize
  the delivery of images that are critical to user experience above other
  images, but below the CSS files.  But with the HTTP/2 prioritization scheme,
  it is impossible for the server to determine how such images should be
  prioritized against other responses that use the client-driven prioritization
  tree, because every client builds the HTTP/2 prioritization tree in a
  different way.
* It does not define a method that can be used by a server to express the
  priority of a response.  Without such a method, intermediaries cannot
  coordinate client-driven and server-driven priorities.
* The design cannot be ported cleanly to HTTP/3 ({{?I-D.ietf-quic-http}}).  One
  of the primary goals of HTTP/3 is to minimize head-of-line blocking.
  Transmitting the evolving representation of a "prioritization tree" from the
  client to the server requires head-of-line blocking.

Based on these observations, this document defines the Priority HTTP header
field that can be used by both the client and the server to specify the
precedence of HTTP responses in a standardized, extensible, protocol-version-
independent, end-to-end format. This header-based prioritization scheme can act
as a substitute for the HTTP/2 frame-based prioritization scheme (see
{{coexistence}}).

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

The terms sh-token and sh-boolean are imported from
{{!STRUCTURED-HEADERS=I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}.

Example HTTP requests and responses use the HTTP/2-style formatting from
{{?RFC7540}}.

# Negotiating Priorities

The HTTP/2 specification defines a priority scheme in [RFC7540],
Section 5.3, which some implementers have opted not to fully support.
The lack of signalling about the status of the implementation has
caused several implementations to implement heuristics to detect when
the clients they are connected to do not support priorities as
defined and take steps to compensate for that.

The intent of this negotiation is to provide a signalling mechanism
for each peer to communicate which, if any, priority schemes are
supported, as well as the server's ranked preference.

For both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, either peer's SETTINGS may arrive first,
so any negotiation must be unilateral and not rely upon receiving
the peer's SETTINGS value.

Implementations are likely to only use one prioritization scheme at
once, and may be unable to change the scheme once established, so the
setting MUST be sent prior to the first request if it is ever sent.
In HTTP/3, SETTINGS may arrive after the first request even if
they are sent first.  In order to avoid the server incorrectly
choosing a priority scheme in HTTP/3, the client SHOULD only send
priority information prior to receiving the server's SETTINGS if
it only offers a single scheme.  If it offers multiple schemes,
the client SHOULD delay sending priority information until
after it knows what the server supports, or risk the server
choosing a sub-optimal scheme.

## The SETTINGS_PRIORITIES SETTINGS Parameter

This document adds a new SETTINGS parameter to those defined by
[RFC7540], Section 6.5.2.

The new parameter name is SETTINGS_PRIORITIES, which allows both
peers to indicate which prioritization schemes they support.

A value of 0 indicates no support for priorities. If either side sends the
parameter with a value of 0, clients SHOULD NOT send priority frames
and servers SHOULD NOT make any assumptions based on the presence or
lack thereof of priority frames.

If the value is non-zero, then the least significant 8 bits indicates the
peer's preferred priority scheme, the second least significant 8 bits
indicates the peer's second choice, and so on.  This allows expressing
support for 4 schemes in HTTP/2 and 7 in HTTP/3.  If any octet is 0,
all more significant octets MUST also be 0.

In HTTP/2, the setting SHOULD appear in the first SETTINGS frame and peers
MUST NOT process the setting if it's received multiple times in order to
avoid changing the agreed upon prioritization scheme.

If there is a prioritization scheme supported by both the client and server,
then the servers's preference order prevails and both peers SHOULD
only use the agreed upon priority scheme for the remainder of the session.
The server chooses because it is in the best position to know what
information from the client is of the most value.

An 8 bit value of 1 in HTTP/2 indicates support for HTTP/2 priorities
as defined in Section 5.3 of [RFC7540] and is an error in HTTP/3 because
there is not a clean mapping to HTTP/3.



# The Priority HTTP Header Field

The Priority HTTP header field can appear in requests and responses. A client
uses it to specify the priority of the response. A server uses it to inform
the client that the priority was overwritten. An intermediary can use the
Priority information from client requests and server responses to correct or
amend the precedence to suit it (see {{merging}}).

The value of the Priority header field is a Structured Headers Dictionary
({{!STRUCTURED-HEADERS}}). Each dictionary member represents a parameter of the
Priority header field. This document defines the `urgency` and `progressive`
parameters. Values of these parameters MUST always be present. When any of the
defined parameters are omitted, or if the Priority header field is not used,
their default values SHOULD be applied.

Unknown parameters MUST be ignored.

## urgency

The `urgency` parameter takes an integer between -1 and 6 as shown below:

| Urgency         | Definition                        |
|----------------:|:----------------------------------|
|              -1 | prerequisite ({{prerequisite}})   |
|               0 | default ({{default}})             |
| between 1 and 5 | supplementary ({{supplementary}}) |
|               6 | background ({{background}})       |
{: #urgencies title="Urgencies"}

The value is encoded as an sh-integer.  The default value is zero.

A server SHOULD transmit HTTP responses in the order of their urgency values.
The lower the value, the higher the precedence.

The following example shows a request for a CSS file with the urgency set to
`-1`:

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /style.css
priority = urgency=-1
~~~

The definition of the urgencies and their expected use-case are described below.
Endpoints SHOULD respect the definition of the values when assigning urgencies.

### prerequisite

The prerequisite urgency (value -1) indicates that the response prevents other
responses with an urgency of prerequisite or default from being used.

For example, use of an external stylesheet can block a web browser from
rendering the HTML. In such case, the stylesheet is given the prerequisite
urgency.

### default

The default urgency (value 0) indicates a response that is to be used as it is
delivered to the client, but one that does not block other responses from being
used.

For example, when a user using a web browser navigates to a new HTML document,
the request for that HTML is given the default urgency.  When that HTML document
uses a custom font, the request for that custom font SHOULD also be given the
default urgency.  This is because the availability of the custom font is likely
a precondition for the user to use that portion of the HTML document, which is
to be rendered by that font.

### supplementary

The supplementary urgency indicates a response that is helpful to the client
using a composition of responses, even though the response itself is not
mandatory for using those responses.

For example, inline images (i.e., images being fetched and displayed as part of
the document) are visually important elements of an HTML document.  As such,
users will typically not be prevented from using the document, at least to some
degree, before any or all of these images are loaded.  Display of those images
are thus considered to be an improvement for visual clients rather than a
prerequisite for all user agents.  Therefore, such images will be given the
supplementary urgency.

Values between 1 and 5 are used to represent this urgency, to provide
flexibility to the endpoints for giving some responses more or less precedence
than others that belong to the supplementary group. {{merging}} explains how
these values might be used.

Clients SHOULD NOT use values 1 and 5.  Servers MAY use these values to
prioritize a response above or below other supplementary responses.

Clients MAY use values 2 to indicate that a request is given relatively high
priority, or 4 to indicate relatively low priority, within the supplementary
urgency group.

For example, an image certain to be visible at the top of the page, might be
assigned a value of 2 instead of 3, as it will have a high visual impact for the
user.  Conversely, an asynchronously loaded JavaScript file might be assigned an
urgency value of 4, as it is less likely to have a visual impact.

When none of the considerations above is applicable, the value of 3 SHOULD be
used.

### background

The background urgency (value 6) is used for responses of which the delivery can
be postponed without having an impact on using other responses.

As an example, the download of a large file in a web browser would be assigned
the background urgency so it would not impact further page loads on the same
connection.

## progressive

The `progressive` parameter takes an sh-boolean as the value that indicates if
a response can be processed progressively, i.e. provide some meaningful output
as chunks of the response arrive.

The default value of the `progressive` parameter is `0`.

A server SHOULD distribute the bandwidth of a connection between progressive
responses that share the same urgency.

A server SHOULD transmit non-progressive responses one by one, preferably in the
order the requests were generated.  Doing so maximizes the chance of the client
making progress in using the composition of the HTTP responses at the earliest
moment.

The following example shows a request for a JPEG file with the urgency parameter
set to `3` and the progressive parameter set to `1`.

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /image.jpg
priority = urgency=3, progressive=?1
~~~

# Merging Client- and Server-Driven Parameters {#merging}

It is not always the case that the client has the best understanding of how the
HTTP responses deserve to be prioritized.  For example, use of an HTML document
might depend heavily on one of the inline images.  Existence of such
dependencies is typically best known to the server.

By using the "Priority" response header, a server can override the
prioritization hints provided by the client.  When used, the parameters found
in the response header field overrides those specified by the client.

For example, when the client sends an HTTP request with

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /menu.png
priority = urgency=3, progressive=?1
~~~

and the origin responds with

~~~ example
:status = 200
content-type = image/png
priority = urgency=1
~~~

the intermediary's understanding of the urgency is promoted from `3` to `1`,
because the server-provided value overrides the value provided by the client.
The progressiveness continues to be `1`, the value specified by the client, as
the server did not specify the `progressive` parameter.

# Coexistence with HTTP/2 Priorities {#coexistence}

Standard HTTP/2 ({{!RFC7540}}) endpoints use frame-based prioritization, whereby
a client sends priority information in dedicated fields present in HEADERS and
PRIORITY frames. A client might instead choose to use header-based
prioritization as specified in this document.

## The SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY SETTINGS Parameter

To improve communication of the client's intended prioritization scheme, this
document specifies a new HTTP/2 SETTINGS parameter with the name
`SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY`. The value of the parameter MUST be 0 or 1; the
initial value is 0. Frame-based prioritization is respected when the value is 0,
or when the server does not recognize the setting.

An HTTP/2 client that uses header-based priority SHOULD send a
`SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY` parameter with a value of 1 when connecting to
a server.

An intermediary SHOULD send a `SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY` parameter with a
value of 1 for a connection it establishes when, and only when, all the requests
to be sent over that connection originate from a client that utilizes this
header-based prioritization scheme. Otherwise this settings parameter SHOULD be
set to 0.

A client or intermediary MUST NOT send a `SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY`
parameter with the value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1.

A server MUST NOT send a `SETTINGS_HEADER_BASED_PRIORITY` parameter. Upon
receipt, a client that supports header-based prioritization MUST close the
connection with a protocol error. Non-supporting clients will ignore this
extension element (see {{!RFC7540}}, Section 5.5).

# Considerations

## Why use an End-to-End Header Field?

Contrary to the prioritization scheme of HTTP/2 that uses a hop-by-hop frame,
the Priority header field is defined as end-to-end.

The rationale is that the Priority header field transmits how each response
affects the client's processing of those responses, rather than how relatively
urgent each response is to others.  The way a client processes a response is a
property associated to that client generating that request.  Not that of an
intermediary.  Therefore, it is an end-to-end property.  How these end-to-end
properties carried by the Priority header field affect the prioritization
between the responses that share a connection is a hop-by-hop issue.

Having the Priority header field defined as end-to-end is important for caching
intermediaries.  Such intermediaries can cache the value of the Priority header
field along with the response, and utilize the value of the cached header field
when serving the cached response, only because the header field is defined as
end-to-end rather than hop-by-hop.

It should also be noted that the use of a header field carrying a textual value
makes the prioritization scheme extensible; see the discussion below.

## Why do Urgencies Have Meanings?

One of the aims of this specification is to define a mechanism for merging
client- and server-provided hints for prioritizing the responses.  For that to
work, each urgency level needs to have a well-defined meaning.  As an example, a
server can assign the highest precedence among the supplementary responses to an
HTTP response carrying an icon, because the meaning of `urgency=1` is shared
among the endpoints.

This specification restricts itself to defining a minimum set of urgency levels
in order to provide sufficient granularity for prioritizing responses for
ordinary web browsing, at minimal complexity.

However, that does not mean that the prioritization scheme would forever be
stuck to the eight levels.  The design provides extensibility.  If deemed
necessary, it would be possible to subdivide any of the eight urgency levels
that are currently defined.  Or, a graphical user-agent could send a `visible`
parameter to indicate if the resource being requested is within the viewport.

A server can combine the hints provided in the Priority header field with other
information in order to improve the prioritization of responses.  For example, a
server that receives requests for a font {{?RFC8081}} and images with the same
urgency might give higher precedence to the font, so that a visual client can
render textual information at an early moment.

## Reprioritization

Once a client sends a request, it cannot reprioritize the corresponding response
by using the Priority header field.  This is because an HTTP header field can
only be sent as part of an HTTP message.

Therefore, to support reprioritization, it is necessary to define a
HTTP-version-dependent mechanism for transmitting the priority parameters.

One approach that we can use in HTTP/2 ({{?RFC7540}}) is to use a frame that
carries the priority parameters.

~~~ drawing
  0                   1                   2                   3
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
 |R|                        Stream ID (31)                       |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
 |                   Priority Field Value (*)                  ...
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-reprioritization-frame title="Reprioritization frame payload"}

The Reprioritization frame would be sent on stream 0.  This frame carries the
stream ID of the response that is being reprioritized, and the updated priority
in ASCII text, using the same represententation as that of the Priority header
field value.

As an example, a web browser might issue a prefetch request for an HTML on
stream 31, with the urgency parameter of the Priority request header field set
to `background`.  Then, when the user navigates to the HTML while prefetch is in
action, it would send a reprioritization frame with the stream ID set to 31, and
the priority field value set to `urgency=0`.
